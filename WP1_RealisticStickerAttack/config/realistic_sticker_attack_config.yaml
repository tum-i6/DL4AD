# MODEL PROPERTIES
model_name: ResNeXt101  # Name of the classification model being targeted for the attack. See the list at the bottom of this page for all the supported models.
weights_path: /path/to/weights.pt  # Path to the model weights of the victim model.

# ATTACK PROPERTIES
attack_algorithm: MCSA  # Name of the attack algorithm used for the Realistic Sticker Attack. Options: SSA (Saliency Sticker Application), MCSA (Monte Carlo Sticker Application) or RSA (Random Sticker Application).
true_target_class: 1  # The true class index (label) of the train/validation data. The class which is being attacked.
true_target_classes: [1,13,14,17,28]  # The true class index (label) of the train/validation data. The class which is being attacked.
attack_target_class: None  # The class which should be predicted. The target for the attack. Set to None if only misclassification is to be achieved.
data_path: /path/to/data  # Path to the class folder containing the train and validation dataset. Must be consistent with the true_target_class and contain the train_set and validation_set subfolders.
mask_path: .masks/baseline_mask_circle_shape.png  # Path to the attack mask image file, used for constraining the sticker placement.
masks_path: .masks # Path to the attack mask image file, used for constraining the sticker placement.
stickers_path: /path/to/sticker_pool  # Path to the folder containing the sticker textures.

# STICKER PROPERTIES
max_sticker_amount: 5  # Maximum amount of stickers to be applied.
repeating_stickers: False  # Whether the same sticker texture can occur more than one time.
min_sticker_area: 1000  # Minimum pixel area of a sticker.
max_sticker_area: 5000  # Maximum pixel area of a sticker.
min_sticker_length: 10  # Minimum pixel length of a sticker.
max_sticker_length: 70  # Maximum pixel length of a sticker.
min_sticker_ratio: 1.5  # Minimum height/width pixel ratio of a sticker.
max_sticker_ratio: 1.5  # Maximum height/width pixel ratio of a sticker.
max_rotation_angle: 180  # Specifies the maximum rotation angle for a sticker.

# TRAINING PARAMETERS
device_ids: '0,1,2,3'  # GPU index values for training on multiple GPUs (e.g. '0,1,3'). Irrelevant if training on CPU.
num_epochs: 100  # Amount of epochs for searching the strongest sticker attack.

# OUTPUT PARAMETERS
output_path: /path/to/experiment_outputs  # Path to the output folder, where the attack sessions will be stored.
